This repository's code has been completely consumed in [[https://github.com/russmatney/clawe][russmatney/clawe]], where
it has evolved along with that monorepo.

The latest now supports downloading games from lichess [[https://github.com/russmatney/clawe/blob/db7042b02ba8ed9f8dc35f98c901a8ff5d07953b/src/chess/db.clj][into a datascript db]] and
[[https://github.com/russmatney/clawe/blob/db7042b02ba8ed9f8dc35f98c901a8ff5d07953b/src/components/chess.cljs][components for rendering games via chessground]].

* Some tools for chess.

Initially created to ease bulk import to lichess.
